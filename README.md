# Deep Learning Facial Recognition System Using VGGFace
[![Made withJupyter](https://img.shields.io/badge/Made%20with-Jupyter-orange?style=for-the-badge&logo=Jupyter)](https://jupyter.org/try)

The notebook uses the pretrained VGGFace model to compare faces from images and recognises/matches them.

# Demo
The entire code is available in this [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/yasserius/facial-recognition-VGGFace/blob/main/facial_recognition.ipynb).

# Application and Further Development
* Applications include a door camera that recognizes the owner, identification of persons from CCTV camera and many more.
* The model can be trained on new faces and the performance can be improved.
